Feel free to use or reuse my code and use my program. Please note that the times and running pace will be in decimal format not in proper time format, so please estimate and only use decimal values when putting in numeric values such as time, pace, or distance. Note that you must enter or calculate a running time or you will not be able to calculate V02 max levels. Program may require opening an online seperate python compiler to run this program. V02 max levels are calculated with 90% confidence meaning that this is not 100% accurate, but is mostly accurate.
